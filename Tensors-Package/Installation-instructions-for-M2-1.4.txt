To run the Tensors.m2 package with Macaulay2 version 1.4, you first need to replace the file

"Macaulay2-1.4/share/Macaulay2/Core/matrix1.m2"

with the version of matrix1.m2 provided in the same directory as these instructions.

The only change is that line 102 of the original file, 

	  assert( class N === Module );

needs to be replaced by

	  assert instance(N,Module);

This change should have no effect on the operation of other packages.  In future versions of M2, Dan Grayson has decided to exclude this assertion entirely.
